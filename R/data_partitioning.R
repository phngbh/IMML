#' Data Partitioning
#'
#' @description Returns a list with all training IDs and
#' a set of shuffled IDs for feature selection.
#'
#' @param phenotype_IDs A table holding the clinical IDs with a variable indicating,
#' if the disease occurred or not.
#' @param data_IDs A table holding all the clinical IDs with the respective IDs
#' for each modality.
#' @param partitioning A value, that signals what percentage of IDs are used for
#' training in the feature selection.
#' @param type This variable signals, if the training or testing set of the
#' feature selection is returned.
#' @param amount The number of partitions that are build for feature selection
#' @param seed The possibility to change the seed, for different results in the
#' part of the ID shuffling for feature selection.
#'
#' @return Returns a list, holding all IDs for model training and a set of
#' shuffled IDs depending on the chosen amount for each modality. The different
#' sets for the modalities are hold separately in extra sublists.
